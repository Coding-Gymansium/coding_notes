# Nico's Portfolio project - 2021

## Concept Brainstorming

### Story

- Navigation bar has 'Home', 'Contact'
- Main page has a hero image
- 'Logo' is my name spelled
- A description or brief intro to who I am and why I love coding.
- Projects section
	- Wordpress sites.
	- School project "Sweater Weather"
	- School project "Rails Engine"
	- Clicking on a project thumbnail takes the visitor to a show page where the project where I can talk to the project in more detail.

### The app architecture

- rails monolith
- blog app with posts or just spin individual pages per project? Blog posts would be more reusable but it would require login and crud.
